Sound to learn enables the user to do four distinct tasks.
L - List songs
A - Add new song
C - Complete a song
Q - Quit

An error notice will be shown, and the user will be prompted to input one of the four letters in uppercase or lowercase form until one of the letters is entered.
Once one of the first three operations (L - List songs, A - Add new song, C - Finish a song, Q - Quit) has finished running, the menu will reappear and prompt the user to make a selection.
